    <p>Input placeholder is usefull to give user example for what you expect user to input.
        For example, you wanna user to input their city name
    </p>

    <div>
        <label for="city">City</label>
        <div>
            <input type="text" placeholder="Jakarta">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Above input use `Jakarta` as placeholder, so this example will give idea to user
        what should they input for.
    </p>
    <p>But remember, placeholder can't be used as label replacement. They are two different
        things. Cause placeholder will disappear once user type something on it.
