    <title>Autocomplete</title>

<body>

    <p>There is incredible input property that makes user life easier. Yeah it's autocomplete.
        This property will help user to autocomplete identical inputs they have filled before, even on from sites.
        Look this example:
    </p>

    <div>
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input type="email" autocomplete="email">
    </div>

    <p>Above input used `email` as autocomplete value. You may can see any email suggested to be inputed.
        But this depend on your browser setting to, if you disable browser autofill/autocomplete feature, this beautiful feature won't work.
