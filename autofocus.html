    <p>Input autofocus will help user to immediately type to your input form on the first load. For example you can see google.com and you will find that the search input is autofocused for you. So you can type directly what you wanna search on it.</p>

    <div>
        <label for="search">Search Something</label>
        <input type="text" id="search" name="search" placeholder="Search something..." autofocus>
    </div>

    <p>yep, above is example of autofocus implementation.</p>
